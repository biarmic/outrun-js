# OutRun
This project is an imitation of Sega's arcade racing game [Out Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run). While some parts of the project are directly imitated from the original game, some parts do not exist in the original game.

Most of the original sprites are not used in this project because of copyright concerns.
